## üöÄ Usage Examples

### Basic Service Usage

```python
from vpn_merger.services import get_service_manager, VPNMergerService

# Get service manager
service_manager = get_service_manager()

# Create and register service
vpn_service = VPNMergerService("my_service", {"max_concurrent": 25})
service_manager.register_service(vpn_service)

# Initialize and use
await vpn_service.initialize()
results = await vpn_service.run_comprehensive_merge()
```

### Strategy Pattern Usage

```python
from vpn_merger.core import get_strategy_manager

# Get strategy manager
strategy_manager = get_strategy_manager()

# Use different processing strategies
configs = await strategy_manager.process_configs(configs, "quality_based")
configs = await strategy_manager.process_configs(configs, "geographic")
```

### Event System Usage

```python
from vpn_merger.core import get_event_bus

# Get event bus
event_bus = get_event_bus()

# Subscribe to events
event_bus.subscribe("processing_started", my_handler)

# Publish events
await event_bus.publish("processing_started", {"sources": 10})
```

### Enhanced Registry Usage

```python
from vpn_merger.core import get_enhanced_registry

# Get enhanced registry
registry = get_enhanced_registry()

# Register component with metadata
registry.register_component(
    name="my_processor",
    component=MyProcessor(),
    component_type="Processor",
    tags=["custom", "processor"]
)

# Get component
processor = registry.get_component("my_processor")
```

## üìà Performance Impact

### Positive Impacts
- **Reduced Coupling**: Event system reduces direct dependencies
- **Better Resource Management**: Service layer manages lifecycle
- **Optimized Processing**: Strategy pattern enables performance optimization
- **Improved Caching**: Enhanced registry supports better caching strategies

### Considerations
- **Initial Overhead**: More abstraction layers add some overhead
- **Memory Usage**: Event history and metrics require additional memory
- **Complexity**: More sophisticated architecture requires more understanding

## üîÑ Migration Path

1. **Gradual Migration**: Existing code continues to work unchanged
2. **Service Layer**: Gradually move business logic to services
3. **Event Integration**: Add event publishing to existing components
4. **Strategy Adoption**: Replace hardcoded logic with strategies

### For New Features
1. **Interface-First**: Define interfaces before implementations
2. **Service-Based**: Implement new features as services
3. **Event-Driven**: Use events for component communication
4. **Strategy-Based**: Use strategies for configurable behavior
